## What next?

- Why not make a second UDS device, so that you can have a pair of gloves and have binocular bat vision?

- Try playing around with the mathematics of turning distance into a vibration intensity. Can you make the device more sensitive at closer distances?

- Why not sew a UDS into the collar of a jacket, so you can detect when someone is sneaking up on you from behind?
