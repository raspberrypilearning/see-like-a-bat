## Making it wearable

To finish off you can make your device into a wearable.

- Sew or glue the UDS to the palm side of a glove:

- Sew or glue the vibration motor to the inside of the glove, so it rests on the palm:

- Place the Raspberry Pi or Pi Zero on your wrist, along with a battery, and secure it in place with a wrist band.

Now you should be able to hold up your hand and detect objects that come close to you, or that you come close to.
