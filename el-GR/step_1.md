## What you will make
In this resource you will make an echolocation device using your Raspberry Pi, which can be worn and which will help you see like a bat.

## What you will learn
By creating an echolocation device with your Raspberry Pi, you will learn:

- How to set up a potential divider
- How to set up an ultrasonic distance sensor
- How to calculate range from ultrasonic pulses
- How to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control a small motor
- How to use functions to solve abstract mathematical problems

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
- [Use manufacturing techniques and tools to create prototype projects](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/manufacture/builder)
