## Adding flying leads to the vibration motor

The chances are that the vibration motor you have purchased (or scavenged) will have a pair of very short leads running from it. So the first thing you need to do is to attach some longer leads. This is usually easiest to carry out using a soldering iron, although you may get away with twisting the wires together and securing them with lots of insulating tape.

- Take your vibration motor and secure it in place.

- Use the tip of your soldering iron to heat up the ends of the leads, and then apply a little solder to both leads so they become coated in it. This is known as tinning.

- Take about 60cm of red and black multi-core wire, and strip the insulating plastic from the ends of each.

- Now tin the ends of your multi-core wire.

- Secure your vibration motor once again, then touch the leads to the multi-core wire and apply a little heat to melt the solder they are tinned with. They should join together and form a secure bond.

- Use some insulating tape or heat-shrink to wrap both wires.
